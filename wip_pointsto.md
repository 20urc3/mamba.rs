In computer science, pointer analysis, or points-to analysis, is a static code analysis technique that establishes which pointers, 
or heap references, can point to which variables, or storage locations. This is the most common colloquial use of the term.
A secondary use has pointer analysis be the collective name for both points-to analysis, defined as above, and alias analysis. 
Points-to and alias analysis are closely related but not always equivalent problems. 

Alias analysis is a technique in compiler theory, used to determine if a storage location may be accessed in more than one way. 
Two pointers are said to be aliased if they point to the same location.
